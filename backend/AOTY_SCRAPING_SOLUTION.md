# AOTY Scraping: Problem Analysis & Solution

## üö® Current Issue

**Album of the Year (AOTY) is actively blocking automated requests** with 403 Forbidden errors. This affects both:

- Playwright-based scraping (timeouts, then 403s)
- HTTP requests (immediate 403s)

## üîç What We Discovered

1. **Initial Success ‚Üí Progressive Blocking**: AOTY works briefly, then becomes very slow and stops working
2. **Anti-Bot Measures**: The site implements aggressive detection:
   - Rate limiting
   - Browser fingerprinting detection
   - Progressive blocking of IPs
   - 403 Forbidden responses

## ‚úÖ Our Solution Strategy

### 1. **Primary Data Sources** (Reliable)

- **Spotify API**: ‚úÖ Fast, reliable, comprehensive track data
- **Last.fm API**: ‚úÖ Good for artist/album metadata (when LASTFM_API_SECRET provided)

### 2. **AOTY Integration** (Conservative)

- **Conservative scraper** (`scraper/aoty_conservative.py`):
  - 60+ second delays between requests
  - Aggressive caching (24-hour cache)
  - Graceful fallbacks when blocked
  - Batch processing with strict limits

### 3. **Practical Approach**

```python
# Use this pattern for album data collection:

# 1. Primary: Get core data from Spotify
spotify_data = get_spotify_album(artist, album)

# 2. Secondary: Enrich with Last.fm
lastfm_data = get_lastfm_album(artist, album)

# 3. Optional: AOTY data (only for high-priority albums)
aoty_data = await conservative_search_album(artist, album, force=False)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working

- Spotify integration with fallback mechanisms
- Last.fm integration with graceful degradation
- Conservative AOTY scraper with caching
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rate limiting and retry logic

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Limited

- AOTY scraping (blocked but gracefully handled)
- Need `LASTFM_API_SECRET` for full Last.fm functionality

## üìã Recommendations

### For Development/Testing:

1. **Focus on Spotify + Last.fm** for reliable data flow
2. **Use AOTY conservatively** - only for special requests
3. **Cache any AOTY data** you manage to collect
4. **Test with realistic expectations** about AOTY availability

### For Production:

1. **Implement AOTY request queuing** with very long delays
2. **Consider manual data entry** for key albums
3. **Use multiple data sources** to create comprehensive album profiles
4. **Monitor AOTY status** and adjust scraping frequency

## üîß Usage Examples

### Conservative AOTY Usage:

```python
from scraper.aoty_conservative import conservative_search_album

# Only use for high-priority albums
result = await conservative_search_album("Radiohead", "OK Computer", force=False)
if result:
    print(f"Found: {result}")
else:
    print("AOTY unavailable, using other sources")
```

### Integrated Data Collection:

```python
# This pattern works reliably:
album_data = {
    "spotify": get_spotify_data(artist, album),  # Primary
    "lastfm": get_lastfm_data(artist, album),    # Secondary
    "aoty": await get_aoty_data_if_available(artist, album)  # Optional
}
```

## üìä Current Service Status

| Service | Status     | Reliability | Use Case              |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Spotify | ‚úÖ Working | High        | Primary data source   |
| Last.fm | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Medium      | Metadata enrichment   |
| AOTY    | üö´ Blocked | Very Low    | Special requests only |

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Complete Last.fm setup** (add LASTFM_API_SECRET)
2. **Test with conservative AOTY scraper**
3. **Build comprehensive data pipeline** using multiple sources
4. **Focus on Spotify + Last.fm** for reliable features
5. **Use AOTY sparingly** for high-value albums only

## üí° Key Insight

**The solution isn't to defeat AOTY's anti-bot measures** - it's to build a robust system that works well even when AOTY is unavailable, and only uses AOTY when absolutely necessary.

This approach ensures your application remains functional and responsive regardless of AOTY's blocking status.
