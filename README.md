## Model Design

### ðŸ”¸ Collaborative Filtering (CF)

- Built from play counts and listening behavior
- Uses Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- Predicts latent user-track affinities

### ðŸ”¹ Content-Based Filtering (CBF)

- Embeds mood, genre, and tags using Sentence-BERT
- Computes track similarity with cosine distance
- Useful for cold-starts and fallback recs

### ðŸ”¶ Hybrid Fusion

- Weighted blending of CF + CBF scores
- Tunable or learnable fusion logic
- Produces rich, explainable recs per user or seed

## AOTY Data Scraper

Timbrality includes a sophisticated web scraper that extracts rich music metadata from **Album of the Year (AOTY)**, one of the most comprehensive music databases available. This custom scraper enhances the platform's recommendation capabilities with detailed album ratings, reviews, and metadata.

### ðŸŽ¯ What It Scrapes

**Albums:**
- User scores and rating counts (e.g., "Based on 37,040 ratings")
- Critic reviews from major publications
- Popular user reviews with like counts
- Genre tags and metadata
- Similar album recommendations
- "Must Hear" designations

**Artists:**
- Overall user ratings and rating counts
- Biography and formation details
- Geographic location data
- Complete discography listings
- Genre classifications

**Tracks:**
- Individual track ratings and rating counts
- Track-level metadata and features
- Featured artist information
- Track length and positioning data

### ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

**Web Scraping Engine:**
- **CloudScraper** for bypassing anti-bot protection
- **BeautifulSoup** for robust HTML parsing
- **Async/await** processing for high performance
- **Custom retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Rate limiting** to respect AOTY's servers

**Data Models:**
```python
class Album(BaseModel):
    title: str
    artist: str
    user_score: Optional[float]
    num_ratings: int              
    tracks: List[Track]
    critic_reviews: List[CriticReview]
    popular_reviews: List[AlbumUserReview]
    
class Track(BaseModel):
    title: str
    rating: Optional[int]
    num_ratings: int              
    featured_artists: List[str]
```

**API Endpoints:**
```bash
GET /scraper/album?artist=Radiohead&album=OK+Computer
GET /scraper/similar?artist=Radiohead&album=OK+Computer
GET /scraper/artist?name=Radiohead
```

### ðŸ”„ Data Pipeline Integration

**Automated Population:**
```bash
# Add rating count columns to existing tables
psql $DATABASE_URL -f backend/add_aoty_rating_counts.sql

# Populate rating counts for all entities
python backend/populate_aoty_rating_counts.py --type all --batch-size 10
```

**Database Enhancement:**
- Adds `aoty_num_ratings` columns to albums, artists, and tracks tables
- Batch processing with configurable limits
- Resume capability for interrupted runs
- Error handling and logging for production use

**Caching Strategy:**
- **Redis caching** for scraped data with configurable TTL
- **In-memory fallback** when Redis is unavailable
- **Smart cache keys** based on artist/album combinations
- **Cache warming** for popular albums and artists

### ðŸŽµ Use Cases

**Recommendation Enhancement:**
- Weight recommendations by AOTY rating popularity
- Surface critically acclaimed but undiscovered albums
- Filter by minimum rating thresholds
- Include review-based reasoning in AI responses

**Music Discovery:**
- "Similar Albums" recommendations from AOTY's algorithm
- Genre-based exploration using AOTY's tagging system
- Critical consensus analysis for new releases
- User review sentiment for recommendation explanations

**Data Quality:**
- Cross-reference Spotify/Last.fm data with AOTY metadata
- Resolve artist/album name discrepancies
- Enrich sparse metadata with comprehensive AOTY details
- Validate music catalog completeness
