  <h1>Timbrality - AI Powered Music Discovery</h1>
</div>

> **Timbrality** â€” a machine learning-powered music recommendation engine that uses AI agents to create personalized music experiences.

Timbrality is an intelligent music recommendation platform that combines data from **Spotify**, **Last.fm**, and **Album of the Year (AOTY)** to provide personalized music suggestions through conversational AI agents. The platform features a hybrid recommendation system powered by the **Timbral** ML engine and modern web interface built with React and Next.js.

## Features

- **ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Music Agent**  
  Conversational AI agent that understands music preferences and provides intelligent recommendations through natural language interactions.

- **ðŸŽ§ Personalized Recommendations**  
  Hybrid recommendation system combining collaborative filtering and content-based approaches using listening behavior and audio features.

- **ðŸ”— Multi-Platform Integration**  
  Seamlessly connects with **Spotify**, **Last.fm**, and **Album of the Year** to gather comprehensive music data and preferences.

- **ðŸ“± Modern Web Interface**  
  Clean, responsive UI built with React/Next.js featuring chat interface, playlist management, and real-time music discovery.

- **ðŸŽµ Smart Playlist Creation**  
  AI-generated playlists with Spotify integration for seamless music discovery and playlist management.

- **âš¡ High-Performance Backend**  
  FastAPI-powered backend with multi-tier caching (Redis + in-memory), rate limiting, and async processing.

- **ðŸ“Š Rich Music Metadata**  
  Enhanced with AOTY ratings, reviews, tags, and similar album data through custom web scraping pipeline.

## Architecture Overview

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Multi-tier caching**: Redis primary + in-memory fallback
- **Rate limiting**: 30 requests/minute via SlowAPI  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic migrations
- **Web scraping**: Playwright browser automation for AOTY data
- **AI Agent**: NLP processor with tool registry for music recommendations

### ML Service (Timbral Engine)
- **Hybrid recommendation engine**: NMF collaborative + BERT content-based filtering
- **Dedicated FastAPI service**: Port 8001 with ML-specific endpoints
- **Model serving**: Redis-cached recommendations with explainability
- **HTTP integration**: Proxied through main backend at `/timbral/*` routes

### Frontend 
- **Main site**: Vite + React + shadcn/ui components
- **Auth app**: Next.js application for OAuth flows
- **State management**: React Context + Supabase auth

### Key Components
- `/backend/agent/`: AI agent core, tools, and NLP processing
- `/backend/routes/`: API endpoints (agent, albums, playlists, users, timbral)
- `/backend/services/`: Business logic (Spotify, Last.fm, ML, AOTY)
- `/backend/ingestion/`: Data pipeline for music metadata
- `/ml/timbral/`: Timbral ML engine (models, training, inference)
- `/frontend/app/`: Next.js authentication and chat interface

## Model Design

### ðŸ”¸ Collaborative Filtering (CF)

- Built from play counts and listening behavior
- Uses Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- Predicts latent user-track affinities

### ðŸ”¹ Content-Based Filtering (CBF)

- Embeds mood, genre, and tags using Sentence-BERT
- Computes track similarity with cosine distance
- Useful for cold-starts and fallback recs

### ðŸ”¶ Hybrid Fusion

- Weighted blending of CF + CBF scores
- Tunable or learnable fusion logic
- Produces rich, explainable recs per user or seed
